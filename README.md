# 🏏 IPL Batting Performance Analytics Dashboard — 2025 Edition  
Excel | SQL | Python | Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes IPL batting performance using real statistics collected from the official IPL website (ipl20.com). The data was cleaned using Excel and Python, transformed using SQL, and visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Data Source:** IPL T20 official website  
- **Data Cleaning:** Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Data Transformation:** SQL  
- **Visualization:** Tableau  

## 🗂️ Workflow
1. Collected raw batting data for 150+ IPL players from 10 teams.  
2. Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handling null values, duplicates, inconsistent player/team names).  
3. Engineered new performance metrics such as Explosiveness Score, Impact Index, and Boundary %.  
4. Wrote SQL queries to aggregate player-level KPIs like total runs, strike rate, boundaries per match, and consistency.  
5. Built a Tableau dashboard with KPI cards, pie chart, scatter plot, and player leaderboard to visualize insights.

## 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed
- Total Runs  
- Strike Rate  
- Boundary %  
- Explosiveness Score  
- Impact Index  
- Team-wise batting contribution  
- Player-wise leaderboard

## 📌 Insights from Dashboard
- Identified top run scorers and highest strike-rate players.  
- Highlighted teams with the strongest batting contributions.  
- Showed the relationship between explosiveness score and run accumulation.  
- Enabled comparison of 150+ players across multiple performance metrics.
